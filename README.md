# ECE_198

This is a respository for our group project for ECE 198 at the University of Waterloo. Group members are Adon Ojha and Rashad Jayshanth-Nizar.

Our design in the domain of personal health and medicine is MediMinder Pro™, an automated medication dispensing system. In this repository you will find documentation describing the customer, problem domain, 3D models, circuit schematics, 
energy and risk analysis, requirements, costs, testing, and implementation. Code files written for this design are included In the "Getting Started" and "Code" folders. Schematics and other information are in the "Documentation" folder.

This design was built around the STM32401RE microcontroller from STMicroelectronics.
